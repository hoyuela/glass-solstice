					<h3>Important Information What you need to know about cash advances:</h3>
					<p>Your cash advance credit line is part of your total credit line. Other balances, such as purchases and balance transfers, may limit how much of your cash advance credit line is available. To be sure you can get the cash you want, please check your cash advance credit line before taking a cash advance. We will begin charging interest on cash advances as of the later of the transaction date or the first day of the billing period in which the transaction posts to your account. We apply payments and credits at our discretion, including in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. Each billing period, we will generally apply amounts you pay that exceed the Minimum Payment Due to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs as of the date we credit your payment. Some ATMs may have additional fees and restrictions. Discover is not responsible for third-party delays in processing transactions. Cash advances do not earn rewards. If you need more information, you can find it in your Cardmember Agreement or call 1-800-DISCOVER (1-800-347-2683).</p>

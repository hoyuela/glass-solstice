                    and iPad devices, that informs you when new account information is available.  
                    Depending on your device settings, these alerts can display in the form of badges, 
                    banners or alerts, and be viewed again later on the <a href="#" onclick="navigation('../pushNotification/alertHistory');">Push Alerts History </a> page. You will only receive alerts for which you have enrolled. 
                    These subscriptions can be updated through the <a href="#" onclick="navigation('../pushNotification/manageAlertsOverride');">Manage Text and Push Alerts</a> page on the App.
                     No fees are associated with Push Alerts.

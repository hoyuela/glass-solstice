						Money Messenger Terms of Use
				</div>
				<div class="clearboth">
                <h3>Please read this document carefully and print a copy for your reference.</h3>                

                <p>This Service Agreement states the terms and conditions that govern your use of the Discover Money Messenger service ("Service") provided by Discover Products Inc. ("DFS"). Each time you use or access the Money Messenger service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. We may amend or change this agreement from time to time. If you find the Agreement unacceptable to you at any time, please discontinue your use of the service. DFS, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or access to the Money Messenger services for any reason and at any time. 
 
                </p>

                <h3>1. Sender Eligibility</h3>

                <p>To use the Money Messenger service to send money to another individual, you must be a Discover cardmember with an eligible account or an authorized buyer on that account and be registered for the Account Center on Discover.com. A sender cannot use Money Messenger to send money to themselves. 

                </p>

              
                <h3>2. Recipient Information</h3>

                <p>Recipients must have or register for a PayPal Account at <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal.com</a> within 30 days of the payment being sent in order to access their money. Registering for a PayPal account is free and recipients do not need a Discover card account. See Section 6 for fees that may apply to the Recipient. 

                </p>

                

                <h3>3. Sending Money</h3>

                <p>Senders can send money on Discover.com or Discover Mobile by entering the Recipient's email address or mobile number. PayPal will send an email or text message to the Recipient to let them know you have sent them money and provide instructions on what to do next. Recipients can log into PayPal if they already have an account or sign up for a new account. Signing up is free and only takes a few minutes. After logging into PayPal, the Recipient can transfer the money to their bank account, spend it online at thousands of merchants that accept PayPal, or request a check. See Section 6 for fees that may apply to the Recipient. 

                </p>
				<p> Senders will receive a confirmation email from DFS when the Recipient claims the money. Pending payments (not yet claimed by Recipient) can be cancelled by the Sender from Discover.com or the mobile site. Payments cannot be reversed once they are claimed by the Recipient. Amounts sent to an individual in error cannot be retrieved. </p>
				<p>Payments that are not claimed after 30 days will automatically be credited to your Discover card account as a return and you will receive a notification from DFS via email. Payments that are refunded by the Recipient will also be returned as a credit to your Discover card account and you will receive an email notification from DFS. 
				</p>
                <p>You may view your Money Messenger transaction history within the Send Money section of our site. All transactions will also be reflected on your Discover card account statements. 
				</p>

                <h3>4. Transaction Pricing and Limits</h3>

                <p>Money Messenger transactions are treated as a purchase and will reflect the purchase APR on your Discover card account. These transactions will earn Cashback Bonus automatically. There are no transaction fees to the Sender. 

                </p>

                <p>

                Daily and calendar month limits apply and vary by cardmember. Your individual limits can be found on the Step 1 page of the Money Messenger Send Money screens. Individual limits may change at any time. 

                </p>

                

                <h3>5. Transaction Type</h3>

                <p>The Sender classifies each payment as "Friends & Family" or "Goods and Services" when completing the Money Messenger Send Money form. These classifications are defined as follows: 

                </p>

                <p>
                "Friends & Family" are amounts sent to friend or family without a purchase, gifts, share of lunch bill, etc. Amounts must be sent between two individual persons (not to or from a business) to qualify as Friends & Family 
                </p>
				<p>"Goods and Services" are payments for purchase of goods or services ("commercial transactions"), sent to a business or other commercial or non-profit entity. 
				</p>
                    
				<h3>6. Fees Charged to Recipient by PayPal</h3>
				<p>The Recipient may be charged a fee(s) by PayPal, based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/UserAgreement_full&locale.x=en_US#8.%20Fees">PayPal User Agreement</a> that they agree to when opening their PayPal account. There are no fees to the Recipient for domestic "Friends & Family" transactions. When the Sender selects "Goods & Services" as the transaction type, the Recipient is charged a Purchase Payment fee. Additional fees apply for the Recipient if you are sending or receiving money to or from a country outside the United States, transacting in a foreign currency or if the Recipient converts their money into another currency. The Recipient should refer to their PayPal User Agreement for a complete list and details of applicable fees that may be charged to them by PayPal. </p>

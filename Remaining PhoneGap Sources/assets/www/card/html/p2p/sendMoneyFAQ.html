                                <p>You can send money to anyone with an email address or mobile phone number using Discover.com on your computer or mobile device.  PayPal sends a message to your recipient letting them know their money is ready.  Your recipient signs into their PayPal account to receive the money.  If they don't have a PayPal account, all they need to do is

If you are sending money to friends or family, there are no fees charged to them to accept the money.  If you are sending money to a business for goods or services, PayPal will charge them a fee to accept the money.    </p>
